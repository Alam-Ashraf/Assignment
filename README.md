# Assignment
Kindly check the below data for assignment:

Prepare a sample app with master detail page settings menu to be opened via a swipe from left edge or a hamburger menu. It should have 2 detail pages with a standard content page with a list view of items as default. Another page should be an information form submission page with scroll-able list of fields, respectively.

Following are the things desired in the sample app:

It should be a Xamarin.Forms app with UI defined in XAML ,preferably on MVVM or Prism.
It should demonstrate at least one custom renderer for a control of your choice, preferably on Android & iOS.
List view should be populated via JSON which will be personal details of people. You can create demo JSON yourself or get one from any online source. JSON can be embedded in the project or kept online.
The form page should be a personal information form with fields such as name, profile picture, nationality (picker), date of birth (picker), marital status, sex, and/or any other relevant information you deem relevant to the demo JSON data.
The submission of the above form should take user to a confirmation page, where all the information that was entered is displayed and upon confirmation, the information should be added to the list view on the main content page.
Create one extra sample UI page in Xamarin.IOS,It should navigate from xamarin.forms to xamarin.ios or xamarin.android,preferably on ios (android will get brownie points).
